The goal of `amiga` is to check that your deSolve functions (specifically, your equations) do not have leaks! For example,if you write your equations wrong, you can lose individuals in the system. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of amiga from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("pakdamie/amiga")
```

## Example

Let's think about a simple SIR model. No individuals should be created or removed
from the system. Susceptibles are infected and will eventually recover.


The first function is correct. The second function is not because we forgot a term!
The third one is a valid equation, but it's still a WIP!

```{r example}
library(amiga)

SIR_Model_correct <- function(time,state,parameters){
  with(as.list(c(state,parameters)),{
    dS <- -beta*S*I
    dI <- beta*S*I-gamma*I
    dR <- gamma*I
    return(list(c(dS,dI,dR)))})
  }

SIR_Model_Incorrect <- function(time,state,parameters){
  with(as.list(c(state,parameters)),{
    dS <- -beta*S*I
    dI <- beta*S*I
    dR <- gamma*I
    return(list(c(dS,dI,dR)))})
}

SIR_Model_Next_Step <- function(time,state,parameters){
  with(as.list(c(state,parameters)),{
    dS <- -B + beta*S*I
    dI <- beta*S*I-gamma*I
    dR <- gamma*I
    return(list(c(dS,dI,dR)))})
}
```

What does my package have right now? It can check for very simple leaks and my plan 
is to give you a visualization of where the leak is.

```{r}
check_leaks_fast(SIR_Model_correct)
```
Ideally, we want to create automatic visualization of the compartment models.
```{r}
 extract_system_equations(SIR_Model_correct)|>
  create_adjacency_matrix()|>
  graph_adjacency_matrix()

```

```{r}
check_leaks_fast(SIR_Model_Incorrect)
```

```{r}
check_leaks_fast(SIR_Model_Next_Step)
```


This is my first package. So bear with me.
